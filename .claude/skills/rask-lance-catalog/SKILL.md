# rask lance catalog — the spec and the estate's layer above it

Two contracts stack here, and confusing them is how bugs happen:

1. **The Lance Namespace spec** (lance.org/format/namespace/) — operations, error codes, REST
   grammar. Defines ONLY namespaces (recursive) + tables, and explicitly prescribes **no hierarchy
   enforcement** and nothing above a namespace.
2. **rask's hierarchy** — `project > warehouse > namespace > table`. Everything above a namespace is
   OURS: our objects, our guards, our lifecycle. The spec neither requires nor forbids it.

## The spec surface (verified 2026-08-04 against lance.org)

- **Operations: 54/54 ROUTED, 47 backend-backed.** `tests/integration/test_spec_conformance.py`
  asserts both halves — every spec op has a served route, and the vendored
  `lance_docs/ns_catalog/spec.yaml` still carries 54 ops (a shrunken spec would silently weaken the
  check). The other **7 answer a spec-correct 501** because the native `dir` backend stubs them:
  `rename_table`, `backfill_columns`, `alter_transaction`, `batch_create_table_versions`,
  `batch_commit_tables`, and BOTH materialized-view ops (`docs/COVERAGE.md`). The spec's *minimum*
  is 8 metadata ops; we carry the whole list including versioning, tags, branches, indices and
  transactions.
- **Route grammar:** `POST /v1/<object>/{id}/<action>` — everything a reverse proxy needs (authN/Z,
  routing) is in the PATH, never only in the body. Path/body id conflict → 400. List ops are GET with
  query-param pagination; data ops (create/insert/query) are **Arrow IPC**, not JSON; count/explain
  return plain text.
- **Identifier:** segments joined by the configured delimiter (`$` default) — `["a","b","t"]` ↔
  `a$b$t`. The root namespace is the delimiter itself.
- **Identity headers:** `api_key` → `x-api-key`, `auth_token` → `Authorization: Bearer`; arbitrary
  context maps BOTH WAYS through a `header.<name>` context KEY — `{"header.x-trace-id": "abc"}` is
  sent as `x-trace-id: abc` (prefix stripped) and every response header returns as `header.<name>`
  (`spec.yaml:2471`). The old `x-lance-ctx-<key>` form is superseded and survives only in the
  generated per-model docs. Headers beat body fields.

## The error contract — NEVER invent a status

The spec defines **24 numeric error codes (0–23)** — 22/23 are `TableBranchNotFound` /
`TableBranchAlreadyExists`, added with the branch ops — identical across Python/Java/Rust/REST;
clients dispatch on the **code**, not the HTTP status. On the wire they are **RFC 9457 problem
bodies** (`application/problem+json`).

**The one rule:** an endpoint raises `lance_namespace` typed errors
(`InvalidInputError`, `NamespaceNotFoundError`, …) and lets
`service_kit/lakehouse/ns_errors.py::install_problem_handlers` translate — it maps all 24 codes
(not-founds → 404, already-exists/not-empty/concurrent → 409, `InvalidInput` → 400,
`PermissionDenied` → 403, `Unauthenticated` → 401, `Unsupported` → 501, `Throttling` → 429).
The branch codes were MISSING until 2026-08-04 — a missing branch answered 500 on endpoints rask
ships. `tests/unit/test_ns_errors_contract.py` now pins the map against the ENUM, so the next
spec-added code fails a test instead of a client.
**Never `HTTPException` with a hand-picked status** for domain errors — a 422 was shipped once and
no generated client understood it; fixed to `InvalidInputError` (95ae4cb). `NamespaceNotEmpty → 409`
is the spec's own error for "container refuses while full" — use it, don't mint one.

## rask's hierarchy layer

    project (tenant)  >  warehouse (ONE bucket; a project holds MANY)  >  namespace (self-nesting)  >  table

Three layers, each owned in ONE place:

| Layer | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| shape (what can exist) | the guards in `catalog/api/fga_deps.py` — `require_parent` (a table must have a namespace; rename destinations too), `require_warehouse_scoped` (a top-level namespace only via `POST /v1/warehouses/{id}/namespaces`; **no-op when `warehouses_enabled` is off** — single-bucket deployments have no warehouse to demand), `require_project_exists` (a warehouse's project must have a registry record — 404 naming `POST /v1/projects`), `require_not_protected` (deletion protection — the `force` rule is under Lifecycle) |
| who | the FGA model's `can_*` relations (`service_kit/governed/auth/model.fga`) — the app never invents policy |
| what is possible NOW | the registries, checked BEFORE the native write: **project records** (`catalog/services/projects.py`, `_projects/<id>.json`), warehouse records + `top_ns → warehouse_id → root_uri` bindings (`catalog/services/warehouses.py`) |

**A tenant EXISTS when its registry record does** — not when a warehouse implies it and not when FGA
holds tuples for it. `POST /v1/projects` writes the record AND the creator's `project#admin` tuple in
one operation (estate-admin gated on `can_observe_events` at the root), which is what stops existence
and permission drifting apart. There is **no bootstrap exception** in warehouse-create any more: one
door, and a warehouse-owner cannot ride a create into project admin.

Check order at every create door: **identity (401) → shape (`InvalidInput` 400) → parent exists
(404) → authz (403) → conflict (409) → native write → tuples (`seed_ownership`) → events.** Guards
run BEFORE `native.call` — rejecting after leaves a real Lance object with no authz parent.

`project` and `warehouse` are **control-plane objects, not spec objects** — their endpoints
(`/v1/projects`, `/v1/warehouses`) are ours. Keep their errors in the same problem-body format so
one client error path serves the whole API.

## Storage — what state lives where (and why there is NO app database)

| State | Store |
| --- | --- |
| table data + versions | Lance datasets on object storage (rustfs) |
| project registry (`_projects/<id>.json`), warehouse registry + namespace bindings | JSON records on the control root, CAS'd conditional writes (the `cas` e2e marker proves the primitive) |
| authz | OpenFGA on its chart-managed Postgres |
| lineage | AGE (Postgres), chart-managed |

A relational app-DB was removed at P7a and must not creep back for the catalog: registry writes are
admin-frequency, CAS handles their concurrency, and deletes are bottom-up single-object operations
by design — there is no multi-object transaction to need one. The moment that changes (atomic
cross-object invariants, high-frequency filtered listings), it is a design decision, not a default.

## Lifecycle

Reclamation, scheduling and the GC design live in `open_table_maintenance.md` — read it before
changing anything the sweep, the reconciler or the orphan scan touches.

- Creates are top-down: parent must EXIST (registry), gated on the parent's `can_*`.
- Deletes are bottom-up: a container refuses **409, naming its contents**; `cascade` is explicit;
  warehouse delete gates on the PROJECT's `can_administer`; bucket purge is a **separate opt-in**;
  project delete has **no cascade at all**.
- **`force=true` overrides the `protected` flag and NOTHING else** — the FGA gate runs first and
  identically with or without it. Test both delete doors for force-without-authz.
- **Recoverable drops are OPT-IN (#75).** With `LANCE_TRASH_GRACE_DAYS` > 0 (default 0/OFF, because a
  grace period changes what `drop_table` means for every caller) a drop DEREGISTERS and files a
  `_trash/` record; `POST /v1/table/{id}/undrop` re-registers from it; `GET /v1/table/{id}/tasks`
  shows the pending deadline (§2.4 per-object task visibility). `purge=true` is the explicit
  opt-out — a caller who means "destroy the bytes now" says so. A recoverable drop **does not revoke
  the table's FGA tuples**: the owner is the one person who needs to undrop it, and revoking made
  undrop unreachable for exactly that caller (found by driving the deployed catalog — the unit tests
  run FGA off); the grants die with the bytes, at purge or expiry. `undrop` re-registers with a
  **RELATIVE** location (the final path segment): `register_table` refuses the absolute URI
  `describe_table` had just reported, and the `dir` backend lays tables out flat. The sweep REPORTS
  expired trash and deletes nothing. COVERAGE.md's old "soft-delete is N/A, time-travel replaces it"
  entry was WRONG and is corrected: time-travel does not survive `drop_table`.
  **The CASCADE is recoverable too (#96)**: with a grace period, `drop_namespace(cascade)` never
  issues the destructive native call — a trash record pointing at bytes that call deleted would be
  a lie — and instead DETACHES the subtree (every table deregistered, namespaces emptied
  deepest-first then dropped, one `kind`-tagged record each, shared drop-time `expires_at`; tuples
  KEPT, the same #75 rule). `POST /v1/namespace/{id}/undrop` is the PLURAL undrop: rebuilds every
  trashed namespace under the id shallowest-first, re-registers every trashed table
  (relative-location form), resumable (`exist_ok` creates; already-registered = recovered);
  `GET /v1/namespace/{id}/tasks` shows the subtree's deadline; `purge=true` is the same explicit
  opt-out. A RESTRICT drop stays unrecorded on purpose — it only ever removes an empty manifest
  row. Declared-only tables (no recorded location) are skipped by undrop with a warning: no bytes
  were lost.
- **Protection covers EVERY rung since #73** (2026-08-04): warehouses/projects carry `protected` on
  their registry records; tables/namespaces carry it as a **control-root `_protection/` record**
  (`service_kit.lakehouse.protection`) gating drop/deregister/rename (table) and drop (namespace) —
  deliberately NOT schema metadata, so unprotect is never reachable through the properties door,
  toggling never creates a table version, and the guard answers even for a corrupted dataset. Set
  via `POST /v1/table/{id}/protection` / `/v1/namespace/{id}/protection`, owner-gated (`protection`
  maps to `can_drop`/`can_delete` in `_OWNER_SUFFIX_RELATION` — an unmapped suffix falls to writer
  tier). The record dies with the object: drop/deregister clear it so a reused id can't inherit it.
  A destructive CASCADE destroys its children INSIDE one native call, so they never re-enter this
  door — `drop_namespace` therefore enumerates `_collect_descendants` whenever `behavior=cascade`
  (no longer gated on `fga_enabled`) and protection-checks EVERY enumerated id before anything
  drops, refusing 409 and NAMING the protected descendant; `force` turns the subtree lock exactly
  as at the named rung, and on the force path the descendants' protection records are cleared after
  the drop (the same reuse rule as the named rung). Until that landed the docstring promised
  cascade coverage the code did not have. Trash records for the children landed with #96 — see the
  recoverable-drops bullet.
- **NO EXISTENCE ORACLE on destructive doors (audit #4).** `delete_warehouse`, `delete_project` and
  `_set_warehouse_status` all collapse `PermissionDenied → TableNotFound`, so "not yours" and "does
  not exist" are byte-identical and the door cannot enumerate ids. CREATE doors deliberately do the
  opposite (`require_project_exists` 404s naming `POST /v1/projects`) because that 404 is a fix the
  caller needs. Class rule, not a per-endpoint judgement call.
- **A purge must prove sole ownership first.** One project may back two warehouses with one bucket
  (`projects_claiming_bucket` subtracts the caller's own project on purpose — the work+gold pair),
  so `?purge_bucket=true` checks same-project siblings AND the reserved platform buckets before the
  cascade. Without it, deleting the work warehouse wiped gold's data.
- Anything making a DESTRUCTIVE decision reads `read_bindings` (which returns unparseable paths) and
  refuses on a non-empty skip list; `list_bindings` is the tolerant half, for enumeration only. A
  binding you cannot read is a namespace you cannot see.
- `deactivate` = offboarding step one (quarantine; resolver 403s bound namespaces).
- Maintenance (compaction + `optimize_indices` + `cleanup_old_versions` with tags EXEMPT) lives in
  **`services/maintenance`** (renamed from `compaction` — it does four things, not one) —
  `catalog/api/maintenance_mode.py` is read-only maintenance MODE (503 + Retry-After), not this. The
  operations are ONE ordered pass per dataset — **compact → optimize_indices → cleanup**
  (`maintenance/services/optimize.py:119-199`): compaction obsoletes files, the index optimize folds
  the new fragments back in, and version reclamation runs last. Read the body, not `compact_one`'s
  docstring, which states the order wrongly. A policy may skip a STEP
  (`cleanup_enabled`/`optimize_indices_enabled`), never reorder them — which is why they are modules
  in one service rather than four services each rescanning every bucket.
- The reconciler reports cross-store drift and deletes nothing until its report runs clean. It runs on
  its OWN Dapr cron binding (`maintenance-reconcile-cron`), separate from the sweep's — a read-only
  drift report must not inherit the data-rewriting sweep's cadence.
- **OpenFGA rejects a bare-type Read.** `read_tuples(obj="project:")` with no user is HTTP 400
  (*"the object id and user cannot be empty"*), and the wrapper reports it as
  `ServiceUnavailableError` — so it presents as a permanent outage on a healthy server. To enumerate
  by type, read the WHOLE store unfiltered and bucket client-side; governance tuples are
  admin-frequency, and a real estate fits in one page. Measured live 2026-08-04, after four detectors
  shipped green against a double that accepted the filter.

## Gotchas

- `deregister` keeps bytes ON PURPOSE (external data); `drop` removes them. Neither leaves Lance
  orphans — but partially-failed writes and unpurged buckets do, and nothing reclaims those yet.
  `services/maintenance`'s orphan pass REPORTS them (`MAINTENANCE_ORPHAN_SCAN_ENABLED`, off by
  default — it opens every dataset, unlike the rest of the drift report which compares three stores).
- **Three Lance file classes look like orphans and are not.** A scan that names any of them would
  drive a reclaimer into live data, and all three were found by running against a real estate, not by
  reading the layout doc: `_refs/tags/*.json` are TAGS, which PIN versions (`cleanup_old_versions`
  exempts tagged versions for that reason); `.lance-reserved` is a structural marker; and a large
  binary column's bytes live in `data/<data-file-stem>/*.blob`, a SIDECAR that `data_files()` does not
  name — the first live run called 29 MB of real page images reclaimable. Conversely `_transactions/
  *.txn` genuinely accumulate forever (the spec keeps one per commit attempt) and nothing prunes them.
- The FGA-only live seed (`fga_seed_demo.py`) writes projects no registry knows — the origin of
  "ghost projects". The replacement SHIPPED: `scripts/seed_estate.py` drives the real doors in
  hierarchy order — `POST /v1/projects` → `POST /v1/warehouses` → `POST /v1/warehouses/{id}/namespaces`
  → `/declare` → `POST /v1/access/tuples` LAST — so every guard runs and a state that cannot be
  reached through the UI cannot be seeded either. A grant whose create failed is SKIPPED rather than
  written; writing it is exactly how a ghost is made.
- **The control-event vocabulary is a wire contract in three files.** `ControlAction` /
  `ControlObjectType` (`service_kit/control_events.py`) reach the frontend through
  `docs/catalog-openapi.json` → `frontend/packages/api/src/generated/catalog.ts`. Adding an action
  without `make openapi` + `bun --cwd=frontend run gen:types:catalog` leaves the TS client unable to
  name an event the backend publishes, and `test_openapi_contract` fails. Same for `TupleOrigin`
  (`service_kit/governed/fga.py`) — an origin string not in the Literal is a `ty` error, not a runtime one.
- The sweep covers EVERY warehouse bucket, not a static list (#81): `run_sweep` unions `s3_bucket`
  + `MAINTENANCE_S3_EXTRA_BUCKETS` with `warehouse_records.maintainable_buckets(registry)` and calls
  `discover_dataset_uris` once per bucket — a bucket is created by an API CALL at runtime, so a
  config-time list goes stale by construction. The orphan scan reads the same registry
  (`_scannable_buckets`), reporting an `IncompleteScan` rather than silently narrowing when it is
  unreadable. Residual: no multi-warehouse run against REAL object storage yet (#80).
- **Five things live in a Lance dataset that a manifest scan does not reach.** Branches (`tree/`),
  multi-base files (`base_paths`), MemWAL shards (`_mem_wal/` — WAL + SSTable datasets, and the spec
  warns that GC'ing WAL files WEAKENS writer fencing, since fencing detects a stalled writer by a
  put-if-not-exists COLLISION), data overlays (`data/overlay-*.lance`, referenced from
  `DataFragment.overlays` not `data_files()`), and blob sidecars (`data/<stem>/*.blob`). The first
  four are REFUSED by `maintenance/services/orphans.py`; refusing overlays is what feature flag 64
  requires, not a shortcut.
- **A dataset's files do not necessarily all live under its prefix.** A named BRANCH is a whole
  parallel dataset under `tree/{branch}/` (its own `_versions`/`_transactions`/`_deletions`/
  `_indices`; branch names may contain `/`), and `lance.dataset(uri)` opens only the MAIN branch. A
  SHALLOW CLONE's data resolves through the manifest's `base_paths[]` to another dataset root
  entirely (feature flag 16). Any "list the prefix, subtract what is referenced" logic reports both
  as garbage. pylance does not expose `base_paths`, so detect the consequence: a referenced path
  that is not present locally.
- **A namespace is a `__manifest` ROW, not a directory** (the `dir` impl the chart runs —
  `LANCE_REST_IMPL=dir`). Only a TABLE materialises a directory. Any scan that enumerates namespaces
  by listing directories silently returns `[]` on every real estate — which reads as "checked and
  clean". The reconciler's `unbound_namespaces` detector shipped with exactly that bug.
- **The `warehouse_binding_cache` is invalidated ACROSS replicas by the control-event broadcast
  (#46, 2026-08-05).** `_resolve_warehouse_root` caches bindings positively and forever on the
  premise that a binding is immutable; the warehouse delete breaks that premise, and the local
  `pop` only fixed the deleting replica. Now `on_control_event` (`catalog/api/dapr.py`) — the same
  broadcast subscription that feeds the ring buffer, no queueGroup so EVERY replica hears every
  event — calls `warehouses.evict_stale_bindings`: `warehouse_deleted` evicts the event's
  `namespaces_dropped` PLUS a warehouse-id scan (a Decision-3 partial delete can unbind more than
  the event recorded); `warehouse_bound` evicts the re-bound namespace; `namespace_dropped` evicts
  the id's top segment. Deactivation is deliberately absent — warehouse STATUS is read live per
  request. The chart couples the two: `services.catalog.replicas > 1` with `catalog.controlEmit`
  off FAILS the render (`chart/templates/services.yaml`), so an overlay cannot scale into
  staleness. (`GET /v1/events`' ring buffer stays per-replica by design — the poll endpoint serves
  each replica's own buffer.)
- The `\Z`-anchored `CONTROL_ID_RE` (`catalog/core/identifiers.py`) is the ONE id-shape rule. It was
  three copies that had already drifted: Python's `$` also matches before a trailing newline, so
  `"acme\n"` was refused by one door and accepted by another.
- Credential-level tenant isolation IS attacked since #74: `tests/unit/test_vending.py` evaluates
  the cross-tenant read/write against the session-policy document the vendor really builds (IAM
  semantics, per tier, with two negative twins — B still reaches B's own table, and a read-tier
  credential cannot write its own), and `tests/e2e-py/test_credential_isolation_e2e.py` drives the
  real attack with vended credentials (LIST/GET/PUT, env-gated — the CI half is #84). The offline
  half deliberately mocks no store: moto does not enforce inline session policies. Byte-placement
  isolation stays proven by `test_warehouse_routing.py` / `test_warehouses_e2e.py`.
